# Twitch Discord Bridge

This project is a simple Docker-contained webapp that serves as a bridge between Twitch and Discord. Whenever the streamer who is logged in goes live, a Discord Webhook is dispatched.

## Setup

You'll need a registered Twitch application and a webhook.

1. Visit the [Twitch Dev Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and create an app. Name it whatever you want, make it of type "Confidential", and set the callback url to your desired domain with the endpoint `/callback`. Note that this URL does not have to be public facing, as long as you can access it.
2. Create a Discord Webhook in a channel of your choice
3. Fill in your config file
4. Profit?

## Config

The configuration for this is stored in `data/config.json`. There is an included example.

```json
{
    "hostname": "http://localhost:8080",
    "discord": {
        "webhook": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
    },
    "twitch": {
        "clientid": "...",
        "secret": "..."
    }
}
```

For those who prefer to use env vars for config, you can do so by the key and prefixing with `CONFIG__`. For nested config options, separate with two underscores.

```bash
CONFIG__HOSTNAME=http://localhost:8080
CONFIG__DISCORD__WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```
